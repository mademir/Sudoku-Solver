# Sudoku-Solver
2 Sudoku Solvers developed in Python using PyGame for the interface. One method uses Backtracking, other uses tile system.

**Note:** This project is for demonstration purposes only. At the moment, inputting custom puzzles is not supported. However, if needed, this can be achieved by altering the sourcecode.
